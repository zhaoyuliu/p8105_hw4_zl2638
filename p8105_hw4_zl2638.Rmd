##This is the fourth homework of Data Science I.

####Problem 1

Load and tidy the data, then draw the plot.

```{r load_tidy, fig.width=10, fig.height=11}
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(haven)
library(readxl)
library(ggridges)
library(ggthemes)

pups_data = read_csv("./FAS_pups.csv", col_types = "ciiiii") %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  gather(key = visit, value = pd_outcome, sex:pd_walk) %>%
  filter(!is.na(pd_outcome)) %>%
  arrange(litter_number, visit)

 ggplot(pups_data, aes(x=pd_outcome,y=litter_number))+geom_density_ridges(scale = 0.95)+ labs(title = "distribution of post-natal days for each developmental landmark", 
      x = "post-natal days",
      y = "landmark number")
```

According to the graph we can see that the distribution of post-natal days for developmental landmark are mainly from 0-5 and 10-5.
